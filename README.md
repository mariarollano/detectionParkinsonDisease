# Detection of Parkinson Disease
Parkinson is a neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 1% of people over age of 60. Its early detection enables treatment interventions and management strategies to be initiated as early as possible, maintaining neuronal function, reducing symptoms, slowing down the progression of the disease and improving the patient`s quality life. However, there is not a unique technique than can be used in its detection. 

I propose an application that contains different exercises that imply mouse movement, that could be useful for its detection. It is a static web page programmed with HTML and JavaScript which consists of several exercises. 
Most of the data extracted was based on mouse tracking. This data consists of a list of horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates of the cursor's locations during the exercises. The extracted features from this data are:
- number of right-left shakes
- number of up-down shakes
- time until the first interaction event
- time between coordinates
- total time session
- handwritting
