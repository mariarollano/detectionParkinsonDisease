<h2><b>What Is Parkinson's? </b></h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects predominately 
dopaminergic neurons in a specific area of the brain called substantia nigra.

<h2><b>Main symptoms of PD </b></h2>
<p>Symptons generally develop slowly over years. The progression of symptons is different 
depending on the person. The most common ones are: </p>
<p>     - tremor, mainly at rest </p>
<p>     - bradykinesia or slowness of movement </p>
<p>     - limb rigidity </p>
<p>     - gait and balance problems </p>

<h2><b>Causes </b></h2>
<p>Scientists believe a combination of genetic and environmental factors are the cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). </p>
<p> - genetics: genetics cause about 10 to 15 percent of all Parkinson's. Scientists have discovered dozens of gene mutations linked to Parkinson's.<p>
<p> - Environmental factors: some environmental exposures may lower the risk of PD, while others may increase it. Environmental risk factors associated with PD include head injury, area of residence, exposure to pesticides and more. </p>
<h2><b> Statistics</b></h2>
<p> - Approximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with PD each year. </p>
<p> - More than 10 million people worldwide are living with PD. </p>
<p> - Incidence of Parkinson’s disease increases with age, but an estimated four percent of people with PD are diagnosed before age 50. </p>
<p> - Men are 1.5 times more likely to have Parkinson's disease than women. </p>
